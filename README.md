#CyberSecurity Anomaly Detection Model Training

This Capstone project was centered around exploring and training an anomoly detection model on the BETH Cyber Security Dataset.
The project was meant to be an initial investigation into the use of machine learning models in a cyber security context.
Insights from this investigation could be used to inform future efforts to create a production Anomaly Detection Model.
